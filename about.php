        <h2>About Us - Smart Street Lighting System</h2>
        <p>Welcome to our innovative <span class="highlight">Smart Street Lighting System</span>! We are passionate about creating sustainable and efficient solutions for urban environments. Our smart lighting technology goes beyond traditional street lighting, incorporating cutting-edge features for enhanced performance and energy conservation.</p>

        <h3>Key Features:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Electricity Conservation:</span> Our system is designed to optimize energy usage by dynamically adjusting the brightness of streetlights based on real-time conditions. This not only reduces energy consumption but also lowers operational costs.</li>
            
            <li><span class="highlight">Fog Detection:</span> With advanced fog detection sensors, our smart streetlights can adapt their luminosity to ensure optimal visibility during foggy conditions. This enhances overall safety for both drivers and pedestrians.</li>
            
            <li><span class="highlight">Rain Detection:</span> The system intelligently responds to rain by adjusting the brightness levels of streetlights. This feature enhances safety during rainy weather and contributes to a more reliable and adaptive urban lighting infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>
